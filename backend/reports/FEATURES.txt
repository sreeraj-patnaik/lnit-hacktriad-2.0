========================================================

PURPOSE
-------
Handles upload, storage, retrieval, and management of
patient medical reports (lab results, prescriptions, imaging).

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
----------------------

1. REPORT UPLOAD
   - POST /api/reports/upload/         → Upload a medical report (PDF/text/image)
   - Fields: patient, report_type, file, description, date_of_report
   - Report types: LAB_RESULT, PRESCRIPTION, IMAGING, DISCHARGE_SUMMARY, OTHER

2. REPORT LISTING
   - GET /api/reports/                 → List all reports for logged-in patient
   - GET /api/reports/?patient=<id>    → Doctor fetches reports for a patient
   - Filters: report_type, date range, status

3. REPORT DETAIL
   - GET  /api/reports/<id>/           → Retrieve single report details
   - PUT  /api/reports/<id>/           → Update report metadata
   - DELETE /api/reports/<id>/         → Delete a report (patient/admin only)

4. REPORT STATUS TRACKING
   - Status flow: UPLOADED → PROCESSING → ANALYZED → REVIEWED
   - GET /api/reports/<id>/status/     → Check current processing status

5. REPORT SIMPLIFICATION
   - POST /api/reports/<id>/simplify/  → Trigger AI simplification for this report
   - Calls the ai/simplify logic and stores result back to report

6. REPORT HISTORY / TIMELINE
   - GET /api/reports/timeline/        → All patient reports sorted chronologically
   - Useful for health trajectory tracking

7. MODELS
   - Report
     Fields: patient (FK → CustomUser), report_type, file, description,
             date_of_report, uploaded_at, status, simplified_text, analyzed

NOTES
------
- File storage: Django media files (local dev), configurable for cloud (S3)
- Restrict report access: patient sees own reports; doctor sees assigned patient reports
- Validate file size and type on upload
